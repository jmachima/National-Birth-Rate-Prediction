National-Birth-Rate-Prediction

written in R markdown notebook.
This project uses random forest regression to model fertility rates of most countries and territories by using attributes such as percentage of women in childbearing age, gdp per capita, average body-mass index, population density, etc.
Birth rate data are mostly from 2018 or earlier.
There are 2 sections of the project. The first one for most of the countries and territories in the world.
The 2nd section deals with countries with birth rates below 2.7 
All developed countries have birth rates below the replacement rate of 2.1, and some are facing rapid population decline.
The attributes used in the algorithm do not include % of families using contraceptives because it is the action directly affecting the birth rate but gives no information on how decisions are made
The attributes selected here represent physical factors limiting the fertility rate and other social/environmental factors that influence a familyâ€™s decision when to have children and how many.
